        <h1>Implicit vs Explicit Communication</h1>
        <a href="http://box5827.temp.domains/~oscaram1/implicit-vs-explicit-communication/">Original Post</a>
        <p>To date, I’ve found that people tend to communicate through implicit or explicit means. Explicit meaning what they say is what they mean and implicit meaning communication layered under what they say. This is probably nothing new to anyone, but what I’ve also found is that sometimes people switch between the two. I’ve oftentimes found myself saying what’s on my mind and then switching to vaguely referring to a concept through another concept. I would then be disappointed when the person I would be talking to wouldn’t immediately understand. Naturally, the onus of communication falls onto me. I would oftentimes switch between implicit and explicit communication styles for the purpose of conveying an idea differently. Being mindful of how you are communicating can lead to a better time talking to someone, and that starts with knowing what each type of communication does.

        <p>  For me personally, I find that explicitly communicating leads to a direct transfer of ideas and knowledge. Think of it like this: “I am telling you something for this reason”. Conveying your thoughts like this allows for less miscommunication. However, there’s not a lot of room for discourse when someone only talks like this. Implicit communication lends itself well to more abstract and metaphorical communication, as well as having the potential to be more powerful and succinct if done correctly. In a way, you’re communicating that “I am telling you something, think about what I’m saying”. This type of communication is very powerful if all parties involved acknowledge the implicit communication and it’s purposefully implicit.

        <p>  Both types of communication styles have their place and purpose, as well as when they should be used. Naturally, explicit communication is very good when you want to directly communicate a thought or concept with limited room for miscommunication. This can be done as an instructional moment, a clarification moment, or just a conversation among others. Where explicit communication is more lacking is in providing nuance. This is where implicit communication shines and should be used. Implicit communication allows for the transfer of deep thoughts and layered knowledge. This can be done when you’re trying to convey multiple ideas to someone or trying to communicate a lot of knowledge swiftly. This comes at the risk of failing the execution. If the other person is unaware of your attempt at communicating in layers, then you will have to engage in explicit communication. This defeats the purpose of implicit communication. Ultimately, being mindful of the topic at hand as well as the audience will allow you to better understand how you should converse.

        <p>    While there are more types of communication styles, I wanted to focus on these two broad types due to their prevalence. Acknowledging how one communicates, as well as how it’s received, can lead to a better understanding of the conversation topic for those involved. I’ve personally found it difficult at times to properly communicate implicitly, which has led to confusion and frustration. Hopefully you’ll have a better time at it!</p>
